I:
two ints

P:

make if loop to cancel code if any number is negative or a non-int
if val1 > val2 newVal1 = val2, newVal2 = val1
make a loop that makes all terms including the bounds into indexes in an array
//make a for loop that adds every term between the small and large number
add all indexes of the array



O:
the sum of every number between(and including) them

rules:


  sums numbers within the range
  works with large numbers
  works with larger number first
  returns ERROR with negative numbers
  returns ERROR with non-number parameters
  returns ERROR with non-number parameters
